%% (At most 350 words for Ph.D.)

Although we now routinely sequence human genomes, we cannot yet confidently identify functional variants. Here a deep mutational scanning framework is developed that combines random codon-mutagenesis and multiplexed functional variation assays with computational imputation and regularization to yield look-up tables for human missense variants. The framework is applied to five proteins corresponding to seven human genes: UBE2I (encoding SUMO E2 conjugase), SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier), NCS1 (neuronal calcium sensor 1), TPK1 (thiamin pyrophosphokinase), and CALM1/2/3 (three genes encoding the protein calmodulin). The resulting functional impact scores correspond to known protein features, and serve to confidently identify pathogenic variation. %Analysis of large-scale phenotypic screens suggests that assays potentially amenable to deep mutational scanning are already available for 57\% of human disease genes.
