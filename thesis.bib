	abstract = {Development of cheap, high-throughput and reliable gene synthesis methods will broadly stimulate progress in biology and biotechnology. Currently, the reliance on column-synthesized oligonucleotides as a source of DNA limits further cost reductions in gene synthesis. Oligonucleotides from DNA microchips can reduce costs by at least an order of magnitude, yet efforts to scale their use have been largely unsuccessful owing to the high error rates and complexity of the oligonucleotide mixtures. Here we use high-fidelity DNA microchips, selective oligonucleotide pool amplification, optimized gene assembly protocols and enzymatic error correction to develop a method for highly parallel gene synthesis. We tested our approach by assembling 47 genes, including 42 challenging therapeutic antibody sequences, encoding a total of {\textasciitilde}35 kilobase pairs of DNA. These assemblies were performed from a complex background containing 13,000 oligonucleotides encoding {\textasciitilde}2.5 megabases of DNA, which is at least 50 times larger than in previously published attempts.},

	abstract = {A strategy, called alanine-scanning mutagenesis, was used to identify specific side chains in human growth hormone (hGH) that strongly modulate binding to the hGH receptor cloned from human liver. Single alanine mutations (62 in total) were introduced at every residue contained within the three discontinuous segments of hGH (residues 2 to 19, 54 to 74, and 167 to 191) that have been implicated in receptor recognition. The alanine scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when mutated to alanine each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the hGH receptor. Many of these residues that promote binding to the hGH receptor are altered in homologs of hGH (such as placental lactogens and prolactins) that do not bind tightly to the hGH receptor. The overall folding of these mutant proteins was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type hGH, as determined by strong cross-reactivities with seven different conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies. The alanine scan also identified at least one side chain, Glu174, that hindered binding because when it was mutated to alanine the receptor affinity increased by more than a factor of four.},

During this time many enzymes that participate in regulated SUMO-conjugation and -deconjugation pathways have been identified and characterized. In parallel, the search for SUMO substrates has produced a long list of targets, which appear to be involved in most cellular functions. Sumoylation is a highly dynamic process and its outcomes are extremely diverse, ranging from changes in localization to altered activity and, in some cases, stability of the modified protein. At first glance, these effects have nothing in common; however, it seems that they all result from changes in the molecular interactions of the sumoylated proteins.},

Binding properties of these variants defined a high-resolution map of mutational preference across the WW domain; each position had unique features that could not be captured by a few representative mutations.

Here we use massively parallel assays to measure the effects of nearly 2,000 missense substitutions in the RING domain of BRCA1 on its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and its binding to the BARD1 RING domain. From the resulting scores, we generate a model to predict the capacities of full-length BRCA1 variants to support homology-directed DNA repair, the essential role of BRCA1 in tumor suppression, and show that it outperforms widely used biological-effect prediction algorithms. We envision that massively parallel functional assays may facilitate the prospective interpretation of variants observed in clinical sequencing.},

The structural basis for these intermediates remains unknown. Here we report crystal structures for human SUMO E1 in complex with SUMO adenylate and tetrahedral intermediate analogues at 2.45 and 2.6 Å, respectively. These structures show that side chain contacts to ATP·Mg are released after adenylation to facilitate a 130 degree rotation of the Cys domain during thioester bond formation that is accompanied by remodelling of key structural elements including the helix that contains the E1 catalytic cysteine, the crossover and re-entry loops, and refolding of two helices that are required for adenylation. These changes displace side chains required for adenylation with side chains required for thioester bond formation. Mutational and biochemical analyses indicate these mechanisms are conserved in other E1s.},

Remarkably, antibodies selected only for binding displayed both general structural features known to be important in nature's own antibodies and specific consensus sequences thought to be critical for interaction with the hapten against which the library was selected.

Our method generates an error estimate for each score that captures both sampling error and consistency between replicates. We apply our model to one novel and five published datasets comprising 243,732 variants and demonstrate its superiority, particularly for removing noisy variants, detecting variants of small effect, and conducting hypothesis testing.

We have performed a genome-wide in vivo screen for protein-protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by means of a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA). We identified 2770 interactions among 1124 endogenously expressed proteins. Comparison with previous studies confirmed known interactions, but most were not known, revealing a previously unexplored subspace of the yeast protein interactome. The PCA detected structural and topological relationships between proteins, providing an 8-nanometer–resolution map of dynamically interacting complexes in vivo and extended networks that provide insights into fundamental cellular processes, including cell polarization and autophagy, pathways that are evolutionarily conserved and central to both development and human health.
A method that identifies pairs of proteins that are 8 nanometers apart produces a map of interacting proteins in living yeast, finding known and previously unknown networks.

A major bottleneck in protein structure prediction is the selection of correct models from a pool of decoys. Relative activities of ∼1,200 individual single-site mutants in a saturation library of the bacterial toxin CcdB were estimated by determining their relative populations using deep sequencing. This phenotypic information was used to define an empirical score for each residue (RankScore), which correlated with the residue depth, and identify active-site residues. Using these correlations, ∼98\% of correct models of CcdB (RMSD ≤ 4Å) were identified from a large set of decoys. The model-discrimination methodology was further validated on eleven different monomeric proteins using simulated RankScore values. The methodology is also a rapid, accurate way to obtain relative activities of each mutant in a large pool and derive sequence-structure-function relationships without protein isolation or characterization. It can be applied to any system in which mutational effects can be monitored by a phenotypic readout.},

	abstract = {As next-generation sequencing projects generate massive genome-wide sequence variation data, bioinformatics tools are being developed to provide computational predictions on the functional effects of sequence variations and narrow down the search of casual variants for disease phenotypes. Different classes of sequence variations at the nucleotide level are involved in human diseases, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, frameshifts, and non-sense mutations. Frameshifts and non-sense mutations are likely to cause a negative effect on protein function. Existing prediction tools primarily focus on studying the deleterious effects of single amino acid substitutions through examining amino acid conservation at the position of interest among related sequences, an approach that is not directly applicable to insertions or deletions. Here, we introduce a versatile alignment-based score as a new metric to predict the damaging effects of variations not limited to single amino acid substitutions but also in-frame insertions, deletions, and multiple amino acid substitutions. This alignment-based score measures the change in sequence similarity of a query sequence to a protein sequence homolog before and after the introduction of an amino acid variation to the query sequence. Our results showed that the scoring scheme performs well in separating disease-associated variants (n = 21,662) from common polymorphisms (n = 37,022) for UniProt human protein variations, and also in separating deleterious variants (n = 15,179) from neutral variants (n = 17,891) for UniProt non-human protein variations. In our approach, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the human and non-human protein variation datasets is ∼0.85. We also observed that the alignment-based score correlates with the deleteriousness of a sequence variation. In summary, we have developed a new algorithm, PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer), which provides a generalized approach to predict the functional effects of protein sequence variations including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, and in-frame insertions and deletions. The PROVEAN tool is available online at http://provean.jcvi.org.},

In the current studies, we have obtained evidence through in vitro studies that the master M phase regulator CDK1/cyclin B kinase phosphorylates the SUMOylation machinery component Ubc9, leading to its enhanced SUMOylation activity. First, we show that CDK1/cyclin B, but not many other cell cycle kinases such as CDK2/cyclin E, ERK1, ERK2, PKA and JNK2/SAPK1, specifically enhances SUMOylation activity. Second, CDK1/cyclin B phosphorylates the SUMOylation machinery component Ubc9, but not SAE1/SAE2 or SUMO1. Third, CDK1/cyclin B-phosphorylated Ubc9 exhibits increased SUMOylation activity and elevated accumulation of the Ubc9-SUMO1 thioester conjugate. Fourth, CDK1/cyclin B enhances SUMOylation activity through phosphorylation of Ubc9 at serine 71. These studies demonstrate for the first time that the cell cycle-specific kinase CDK1/cyclin B phosphorylates a SUMOylation machinery component to increase its overall SUMOylation activity, suggesting that SUMOylation is part of the cell cycle program orchestrated by CDK1 through Ubc9.},

Ubc9, the E2 for SUMO, synthesizes polymeric chains in the presence of its E1 and MgATP. To better understand conjugation of ub-lps, we have performed mutational analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ubc9p, which conjugates the SUMO family member Smt3p. We have identified Ubc9p surfaces involved in thiolester bond and Smt3p-Smt3p chain formation. The residues involved in thiolester bond formation map to a surface we show is the E1 binding site, and E2s for other ub-lps are likely to bind to their E1s at a homologous site. We also find that this same surface binds Smt3p. A mutation that impairs binding to E1 but not Smt3p impairs thiolester bond formation, suggesting that it is the E1 interaction at this site that is crucial. Interestingly, other E2s and their relatives also use this same surface for binding to ubiquitin, E3s, and other proteins, revealing this to be a multipurpose binding site and suggesting that the entire E1-E2-E3 pathway has coevolved for a given ub-lp.},

The mutagenic potential of diverse range of oxidized products is well reported in literature. Incorporation of errors during PCR in the presence of oxidized nucleotides can be a very effective alternative to error prone PCR as the transversion mutation frequency is higher in the former case. Earlier reports used a single purified oxidized nucleotide for introducing mutations during polymerase chain reaction. This could be further improved using the entire range of oxidized nucleotides to widen the mutation spectrum. The highlight of the present work lies in the fact that the oxidized nucleotides used in this study were generated by incubating the mixture of all the four nucleotides (dATP, dCTP, dTTP and dGTP) with an oxidizing agent, ferrous sulphate. This oxidized nucleotide mixture was then directly used without purification in polymerase chain reaction to introduce random mutations. The 100 µM oxidized nucleotides mixture treated with 5 mM FeSO4 for 10 minutes along with 200 µM nucleotides are the optimized parameters for PCR amplification of a desired gene. The effect of manganese and magnesium ions over the incorporation of oxidized nucleotides was also investigated. An optimized PCR based approach which can be an efficient alternative to error-prone PCR for introducing random mutations in a defined gene sequence has been successfully developed.},

Just as reference genome sequences revolutionized human genetics, reference maps of interactome networks will be critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here, we describe a systematic map of ∼14,000 high-quality human binary protein-protein interactions. At equal quality, this map is ∼30\% larger than what is available from small-scale studies published in the literature in the last few decades. While currently available information is highly biased and only covers a relatively small portion of the proteome, our systematic map appears strikingly more homogeneous, revealing a “broader” human interactome network than currently appreciated. The map also uncovers significant interconnectivity between known and candidate cancer gene products, providing unbiased evidence for an expanded functional cancer landscape, while demonstrating how high-quality interactome models will help “connect the dots” of the genomic revolution.},

Higher, lower and neutral affinity mutations are identified by their enrichment or depletion in the FACS subpopulations. We applied this method to a humanized version of the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab, generated a near comprehensive data set for 1060 point mutations that recapitulates previously determined structural and mutational data for these CDRs and identified 67 point mutations that increase affinity.

Using cross-species complementation, model organisms like the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can be utilized to fill this gap and serve as a platform for testing human genetic variants. To this end, we performed two parallel screens, a one-to-one complementation screen for essential yeast genes implicated in chromosome instability and a pool-to-pool screen that queried all possible essential yeast genes for rescue of lethality by all possible human homologs. Our work identified 65 human cDNAs that can replace the null allele of essential yeast genes, including the nonorthologous pair yRFT1/hSEC61A1. We chose four human cDNAs (hLIG1, hSSRP1, hPPP1CA, and hPPP1CC) for which their yeast gene counterparts function in chromosome stability and assayed in yeast 35 tumor-specific missense mutations for growth defects and sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. This resulted in a set of human–yeast gene complementation pairs that allow human genetic variants to be readily characterized in yeast, and a prioritized list of somatic mutations that could contribute to chromosome instability in human tumors. These data establish the utility of this cross-species experimental approach.},

	abstract = {Summary
Evolvability—the capacity to generate beneficial heritable variation—is a central property of biological systems. However, its origins and modulation by environmental factors have not been examined systematically. Here, we analyze the fitness effects of all single mutations in TEM-1 β-lactamase (4,997 variants) under selection for the wild-type function (ampicillin resistance) and for a new function (cefotaxime resistance). Tolerance to mutation in this enzyme is bimodal and dependent on the strength of purifying selection in vivo, a result that derives from a steep non-linear ampicillin-dependent relationship between biochemical activity and fitness. Interestingly, cefotaxime resistance emerges from mutations that are neutral at low levels of ampicillin but deleterious at high levels; thus the capacity to evolve new function also depends on the strength of selection. The key property controlling evolvability is an excess of enzymatic activity relative to the strength of selection, suggesting that fluctuating environments might select for high-activity enzymes.

	abstract = {Influenza genes evolve mostly via point mutations, and so knowing the effect of every amino-acid mutation provides information about evolutionary paths available to the virus. We and others have combined high-throughput mutagenesis with deep sequencing to estimate the effects of large numbers of mutations to influenza genes. However, these measurements have suffered from substantial experimental noise due to a variety of technical problems, the most prominent of which is bottlenecking during the generation of mutant viruses from plasmids. Here we describe advances that ameliorate these problems, enabling us to measure with greatly improved accuracy and reproducibility the effects of all amino-acid mutations to an H1 influenza hemagglutinin on viral replication in cell culture. The largest improvements come from using a helper virus to reduce bottlenecks when generating viruses from plasmids. Our measurements confirm at much higher resolution the results of previous studies suggesting that antigenic sites on the globular head of hemagglutinin are highly tolerant of mutations. We also show that other regions of hemagglutinin—including the stalk epitopes targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies—have a much lower inherent capacity to tolerate point mutations. The ability to accurately measure the effects of all influenza mutations should enhance efforts to understand and predict viral evolution.},

The design process starts with two polar amino acids that fit deep into the enzyme active site, identifies a protein scaffold that supports these residues and is complementary in shape to the lysozyme active-site region, and finally optimizes the surrounding contact surface for high-affinity binding. Following affinity maturation, a protein designed using this method bound lysozyme with low nanomolar affinity, and a combination of NMR studies, crystallography, and knockout mutagenesis confirmed the designed binding surface and orientation. Saturation mutagenesis with selection and deep sequencing demonstrated that specific designed interactions extending well beyond the centrally grafted polar residues are critical for high-affinity binding.},

When applied to the optimization of a model antibody Fab fragment, the strategy created a diverse panel of high affinity variants.

The structural basis behind the multispecific binding profile is not understood. To begin to address this, we applied NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of calcium-bound human NCS-1. The structure in solution demonstrates interdomain flexibility and, in the absence of a binding partner, the C-terminal tail residues occupy the hydrophobic crevice as a ligand mimic. A variant with a C-terminal tail deletion shows lack of a defined structure but maintained cooperative unfolding and dramatically reduced global stability. The results suggest that the C-terminal tail is important for regulating the conformational stability of the Ca2+-activated state. Furthermore, a single amino acid mutation that was recently diagnosed in a patient with autistic spectrum disorder was seen to affect the C-terminal tail and binding crevice in NCS-1.},

Sumoylation is achieved by the sequential action of several enzymes in which the E2, Ubc9, transfers SUMO from the E1 to the target mostly with the help of an E3 enzyme. In this process, Ubc9 not only forms a thioester bond with SUMO, but also interacts with SUMO noncovalently. Here, we show that this noncovalent interaction promotes the formation of short SUMO chains on targets such as Sp100 and HDAC4. We present a crystal structure of the noncovalent Ubc9–SUMO1 complex, showing that SUMO is located far from the E2 active site and resembles the noncovalent interaction site for ubiquitin on UbcH5c and Mms2. Structural comparison suggests a model for poly‐sumoylation involving a mechanism analogous to Mms2‐Ubc13‐mediated ubiquitin chain formation.},

RanBP2 exhibits specificity for SUMO1 as RanGAP1-SUMO1/UBC9 forms a more stable complex with RanBP2 compared with RanGAP1-SUMO2 that results in greater protection of RanGAP-SUMO1 from proteases. The IR1-M-IR2 SUMO E3 ligase activity also shows a similar preference for SUMO1. We utilized deletions and domain swap constructs in protease protection assays and automodification assays to define RanBP2 domains responsible for RanGAP1-SUMO1 protection and SUMO1-specific E3 ligase activity. Our data suggest that elements in both IR1 and IR2 exhibit specificity for SUMO1. IR1 protects RanGAP1-SUMO1/UBC9 and functions as the primary E3 ligase of RanBP2, whereas IR2 retains the ability to interact with SUMO1 to promote SUMO1-specific E3 ligase activity. To determine the structural basis for SUMO1 specificity, a hybrid IR1 construct and IR1 were used to determine three new structures for complexes containing UBC9 with RanGAP1-SUMO1/2. These structures show more extensive contacts among SUMO, UBC9, and RanBP2 in complexes containing SUMO1 compared with SUMO2 and suggest that differences in SUMO specificity may be achieved through these subtle conformational differences.},

Improved methods are needed for the knockout of individual genes in genome-scale functional screens. Wang et al. (p. 80, published online 12 December) and Shalem et al. (p. 84, published online 12 December) used the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system to power-screen protocols that avoid several of the pitfalls associated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens. Genome editing by these methods completely disrupts target genes, thus avoiding weak signals that can occur when transcript abundance is partially decreased by siRNA. Furthermore, gene targeting by the CRISPR system is more precise and appears to produce substantially fewer off-target effects than existing methods.
The bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–Cas9 system for genome editing has greatly expanded the toolbox for mammalian genetics, enabling the rapid generation of isogenic cell lines and mice with modified alleles. Here, we describe a pooled, loss-of-function genetic screening approach suitable for both positive and negative selection that uses a genome-scale lentiviral single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library. sgRNA expression cassettes were stably integrated into the genome, which enabled a complex mutant pool to be tracked by massively parallel sequencing. We used a library containing 73,000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections and performed screens in two human cell lines. A screen for resistance to the nucleotide analog 6-thioguanine identified all expected members of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, whereas another for the DNA topoisomerase II (TOP2A) poison etoposide identified TOP2A, as expected, and also cyclin-dependent kinase 6, CDK6. A negative selection screen for essential genes identified numerous gene sets corresponding to fundamental processes. Last, we show that sgRNA efficiency is associated with specific sequence motifs, enabling the prediction of more effective sgRNAs. Collectively, these results establish Cas9/sgRNA screens as a powerful tool for systematic genetic analysis in mammalian cells.

	abstract = {Ligand-induced clustering of type I cytokine receptor subunits leads to trans-phosphorylation and activation of associated cytosolic janus kinases (JAKs). In turn, JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the receptor tails, leading to recruitment and activation of signalling molecules. Among these, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are important in the direct transmission of signals to the nucleus. Here, we show that incorporation of an interaction trap in a signalling-deficient receptor allows the identification of protein–protein interactions, using a STAT-dependent complementation assay. Mammalian protein–protein interaction trap (MAPPIT) adds to existing yeast two-hybrid procedures, as originally explored by Fields and Song, and permits the detection of both modification-independent and of phosphorylation-dependent interactions in intact human cells. We also demonstrate that MAPPIT can be used to screen complex complementary DNA libraries, and using this approach, we identify cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS) and suppressor of cytokine signalling-2 (SOCS-2) as interaction partners of the phosphotyrosine 402 (Tyr 402)-binding motif in the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR). Importantly, this approach places protein–protein interactions in their normal physiological context, and is especially applicable to the in situ analysis of signal transduction pathways.},

It then estimates the probability of the missense mutation being damaging based on a combination of all these properties. PolyPhen-2 features include a high-quality multiple protein sequence alignment pipeline and a prediction method employing machine-learning classification. The software also integrates the UCSC Genome Browser's human genome annotations and MultiZ multiple alignments of vertebrate genomes with the human genome.

Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) DNA sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72\% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human ‘knockout’ variants in protein-coding genes.

	abstract = {Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a Ca2+ sensor protein that has been implicated in the regulation of various aspects of neuronal development and neurotransmission. It exerts its effects through interactions with a range of target proteins one of which is interleukin receptor accessory protein like-1 (IL1RAPL1) protein. Mutations in IL1RAPL1 have recently been associated with autism spectrum disorders and a missense mutation (R102Q) on NCS-1 has been found in one individual with autism. We have examined the effect of this mutation on the structure and function of NCS-1. From use of NMR spectroscopy, it appeared that the R102Q affected the structure of the protein particularly with an increase in the extent of conformational exchange in the C-terminus of the protein. Despite this change NCS-1(R102Q) did not show changes in its affinity for Ca2+ or binding to IL1RAPL1 and its intracellular localisation was unaffected. Assessment of NCS-1 dynamics indicated that it could rapidly cycle between cytosolic and membrane pools and that the cycling onto the plasma membrane was specifically changed in NCS-1(R102Q) with the loss of a Ca2+ -dependent component. From these data we speculate that impairment of the normal cycling of NCS-1 by the R102Q mutation could have subtle effects on neuronal signalling and physiology in the developing and adult brain.},

The new surface routine, GETAREA, finds solvent-exposed vertices of intersecting atoms, and thereby avoids calculating buried vertices which are not needed to determine the accessible surface area by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. The surface routine was implemented in FANTOM, a program for energy minimization and Monte Carlo simulation, and tested for accuracy and efficiency in extensive energy minimizations of Met-enkephalin, the α-amylase inhibitor tendamistat, and avian pancreatic polypeptide (APP). The CPU time for the exact calculation of the accessible surface areas and their gradients has been reduced by factors of 2.2 (Met-enkephalin) and 3.2 (tendamistat) compared with our previous approach. The efficiency of our exact method is similar to the recently described approximate methods MSEED and SASAD. The performance of several atomic solvation parameter sets was tested in searches for low energy conformations of APP among conformations near the native X-ray crystal structure and highly distorted structures. The protein solvation parameters from Ooi et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84, 3086 (1987)] and from Wesson and Eisenberg [Prot.

Localization of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) restricts the action of this broad specificity kinase. The high-resolution crystal structures of the docking and dimerization (D/D) domain of the RIIα regulatory subunit of PKA both in the apo state and in complex with the high-affinity anchoring peptide AKAP-IS explain the molecular basis for AKAP-regulatory subunit recognition. AKAP-IS folds into an amphipathic α helix that engages an essentially preformed shallow groove on the surface of the RII dimer D/D domains. Conserved AKAP aliphatic residues dominate interactions to RII at the predominantly hydrophobic interface, whereas polar residues are important in conferring R subunit isoform specificity. Using a peptide screening approach, we have developed SuperAKAP-IS, a peptide that is 10,000-fold more selective for the RII isoform relative to RI and can be used to assess the impact of PKA isoform-selective anchoring on cAMP-responsive events inside cells.},

The ability to perturb genes in human cells is crucial for elucidating gene function and holds great potential for finding therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer. To extend the catalog of human core and context-dependent fitness genes, we have developed a high-complexity second-generation genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA library and applied it to fitness screens in five human cell lines. Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we consistently discover 5-fold more fitness genes than were previously observed. We present a list of 1,580 human core fitness genes and describe their general properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that context-dependent fitness genes accurately recapitulate pathway-specific genetic vulnerabilities induced by known oncogenes and reveal cell-type-specific dependencies for specific receptor tyrosine kinases, even in oncogenic KRAS backgrounds. Thus, rigorous identification of human cell line fitness genes using a high-complexity CRISPR-Cas9 library affords a high-resolution view of the genetic vulnerabilities of a cell.},

We extended the selection strategy to the ubiquitin conjugating (E2) and ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes and found that ubiquitin variants can also enhance enzyme activity. Last, we showed that ubiquitin variants can bind selectively to ubiquitin-binding domains. Ubiquitin variants exhibit selective function in cells and thus enable orthogonal modulation of specific enzymatic steps in the ubiquitin system.

	abstract = {SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier)-specific proteases catalyse the maturation and de-conjugation processes of the sumoylation pathway and modulate various cellular responses including nuclear metabolism and cell cycle progression. The active-site cysteine residue is conserved among all known SUMO-specific proteases and is not substitutable by serine in the hydrolysis reactions demonstrated previously in yeast. We report here that the catalytic domain of human protease SENP1 (SUMO-specific protease 1) mutant SENP1CC603S carrying a mutation of cysteine to serine at the active site is inactive in maturation and de-conjugation reactions. To further understand the hydrolytic mechanism catalysed by SENP1, we have determined, at 2.8 Å resolution (1 Å=0.1 nm), the X-ray structure of SENP1CC603S–SUMO-1 complex. A comparison of the structure of SENP2–SUMO-1 suggests strongly that SUMO-specific proteases require a self-conformational change prior to cleavage of peptide or isopeptide bond in the maturation and de-conjugation processes respectively. Moreover, analysis of the interface of SENP1 and SUMO-1 has led to the identification of four unique amino acids in SENP1 that facilitate the binding of SUMO-1. By means of an in vitro assay, we further demonstrate a novel function of SENP1 in hydrolysing the thioester linkage in E1-SUMO and E2-SUMO complexes. The results disclose a new mechanism of regulation of the sumoylation pathway by the SUMO-specific proteases.},

The parasite asexual trophozoite stage is susceptible to iron-induced oxidative stress and is subsequently a target for many of the current anti-malarial drugs. Here, we provide evidence that SUMOylation plays a role in the parasite response to oxidative stress during red blood cell stages, indicative of a protective role seen in other organisms. Using x-ray crystallography, we solved the structure of the human SUMO E1 ubiquitin fold domain in complex with the E2, Ubc9. The interface defined in this structure guided in silico modeling, mutagenesis, and in vitro biochemical studies of the P. falciparum SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes, resulting in the identification of surface residues that explain species-specific interactions.

More powerful genetic techniques are helping to define the list of genes required for the life of a human cell. Two papers used the CRISPR genome editing system and a gene trap method in haploid human cells to screen for essential genes (see the Perspective by Boone and Andrews). Wang et al.'s analysis of multiple cell lines indicates that it may be possible to find tumor-specific dependencies on particular genes. Blomen et al. investigate the phenomenon in which nonessential genes are required for fitness in the absence of another gene. Hence, complexity rather than robustness is the human strategy.
Science, this issue p. 1096 and p. 1092; see also p. 1028
Although the genes essential for life have been identified in less complex model organisms, their elucidation in human cells has been hindered by technical barriers. We used extensive mutagenesis in haploid human cells to identify approximately 2000 genes required for optimal fitness under culture conditions. To study the principles of genetic interactions in human cells, we created a synthetic lethality network focused on the secretory pathway based exclusively on mutations. This revealed a genetic cross-talk governing Golgi homeostasis, an additional subunit of the human oligosaccharyltransferase complex, and a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase β adaptor hijacked by viruses. The synthetic lethality map parallels observations made in yeast and projects a route forward to reveal genetic networks in diverse aspects of human cell biology.

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Nonadditivity in fitness effects from two or more mutations, termed epistasis, can result in compensation of deleterious mutations or negation of beneficial mutations. Recent evidence shows the importance of epistasis in individual evolutionary pathways. However, an unresolved question in molecular evolution is how often and how significantly fitness effects change in alternative genetic backgrounds.
Results
To answer this question, we quantified the effects of all single mutations and double mutations between all positions in the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). By observing the first two steps of all possible evolutionary pathways using this fitness profile, we were able to characterize the extent and magnitude of pairwise epistasis throughout an entire protein molecule. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach to quantitatively determine the effects of single mutations on structural stability (ΔΔGU). This enabled determination of the importance of stability effects in functional epistasis.
Conclusions
Our results illustrate common biophysical mechanisms for occurrences of positive and negative epistasis. Our results show pervasive positive epistasis within a conformationally dynamic network of residues. The stability analysis shows that significant negative epistasis, which is more common than positive epistasis, mostly occurs between combinations of destabilizing mutations. Furthermore, we show that although significant positive epistasis is rare, many deleterious mutations are beneficial in at least one alternative mutational background. The distribution of conditionally beneficial mutations throughout the domain demonstrates that the functional portion of sequence space can be significantly expanded by epistasis.},

The prediction is based on the change, caused by a given variation, in the similarity of the query sequence to a set of its related protein sequences. For this prediction, the algorithm is required to compute a semi-global pairwise sequence alignment score between the query sequence and each of the related sequences. Using dynamic programming, it takes O(n · m) time to compute alignment score between the query sequence Q of length n and a related sequence S of length m. Thus given l different variations in Q, in a naive way it would take O(l · n · m) time to compute the alignment scores between each of the variant query sequences and S. In this paper, we present a new approach to efficiently compute the pairwise alignment scores for l variations, which takes O((n + l) · m) time when the length of variations is bounded by a constant. In this approach, we further utilize the solutions of overlapping subproblems, which are already used by dynamic programming approach. Our algorithm has been used to build a new database for precomputed prediction scores for all possible single amino acid substitutions, single amino acid insertions, and up to 10 amino acids deletions in about 91K human proteins (including isoforms), where l becomes very large, that is, l = O(n).

Oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to positions 582 to 593 of the viral DNA strand of the bacteriophage phiX174 am3 mutant (pGTATCCTACAAA), and to the wild type sequence in this region (pGTATCCTACAAA), were synthesized and used as specific mutagens. Each of these oligonucleotides was incorporated into a complete circular complementary strand when used as primer on a genetically heterologous viral strand template, by the combined action of subtilisin-treated Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and T4 DNA ligase. Incomplete duplexes were removed or were inactivated by nuclease S1 and the products were used to transfect spheroplasts of E. coli. Both oligonucleotides induced specific mutations at high efficiency when used with heterologous template (15\% mutants among progeny phage). The am phages isolated by this procedure are phenotypically gene E mutants, and contain A at position 587 of the viral strand. They thus appear identical with am3 and provide evidence that the change G leads to A at position 587 is sufficient to produce a defective E function. Since the template for the induction of am mutants carried another genetic marker (sB1), the strains carrying the induced mutations have the new genotype am3 sB1. It should be possible to introduce the am3 mutation into any known mutant strain of phi174 using this same oligonucleotide. Both possible transition mutations were induced in these experiments. In principle, the method could also induce transversions, insertions, and deletions. The method should be applicable to other circular DNAs of similar size, for example recombinant DNA plasmids.},

For example, one could set-up a "differential" screen by combining a forward and a reverse approach in a three-hybrid set-up. Another very interesting project is the use of peptide libraries in two-hybrid approaches. This could enable the identification of peptides with very high specificity comparable to "real" antibodies. With the technology available, the only limitation is imagination.},

Once the template DNA is prepared, the method can be completed in a single day in a single tube, and requires no intermediate DNA purification or sub-cloning. PFunkel can be used for site-directed mutagenesis at an efficiency approaching 100\%. More importantly, PFunkel allows researchers the unparalleled ability to efficiently construct user-defined libraries. We demonstrate the creation of a library with site-saturation at four distal sites simultaneously at 70\% efficiency. We also employ PFunkel to create a comprehensive codon mutagenesis library of the TEM-1 ß-lactamase gene. We designed this library to contain 18,081 members, one for each possible codon substitution in the gene (287 positions in TEM-1 x 63 possible codon substitutions). Deep sequencing revealed that ∼97\% of the designed single codon substitutions are present in the library. From such a library we identified 18 previously unreported adaptive mutations that each confer resistance to the ß-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. Three of these mutations confer resistance equal to or higher than that of the most resistant reported TEM-1 allele and have the potential to emerge clinically.},

	abstract = {Disclaimer: These ACMG Standards and Guidelines were developed primarily as an educational resource for clinical laboratory geneticists to help them provide quality clinical laboratory services. Adherence to these standards and guidelines is voluntary and does not necessarily assure a successful medical outcome. These Standards and Guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper procedures and tests or exclusive of other procedures and tests that are reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. In determining the propriety of any specific procedure or test, the clinical laboratory geneticist should apply his or her own professional judgment to the specific circumstances presented by the individual patient or specimen. Clinical laboratory geneticists are encouraged to document in the patient’s record the rationale for the use of a particular procedure or test, whether or not it is in conformance with these Standards and Guidelines. They also are advised to take notice of the date any particular guideline was adopted and to consider other relevant medical and scientific information that becomes available after that date. It also would be prudent to consider whether intellectual property interests may restrict the performance of certain tests and other procedures.
The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) previously developed guidance for the interpretation of sequence variants. In the past decade, sequencing technology has evolved rapidly with the advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. By adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. By virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In this context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising representatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. The group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from ACMG, AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders. These recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the use of specific standard terminology—“pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely benign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified in genes that cause Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommendation describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). Because of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this report, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–approved laboratory, with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent.

	abstract = {Sumoylation regulates the activities of several members of the ETS transcription factor family. To provide a molecular framework for understanding this regulation, we have characterized the conjugation of Ets-1 with SUMO-1. Ets-1 is modified in vivo predominantly at a consensus sumoylation motif containing Lys-15. This lysine is located within the unstructured N-terminal segment of Ets-1 preceding its PNT domain. Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the Ets-1 sumoylation motif associates with the substrate binding site on the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (Kd ∼400 μm) and that the PNT domain is not involved in this interaction. Ets-1 with Lys-15 mutated to an arginine still binds UBC9 with an affinity similar to the wild type protein, but is no longer sumoylated. NMR chemical shift and relaxation measurements reveal that the covalent attachment of mature SUMO-1, via its flexible C-terminal Gly-97, to Lys-15 of Ets-1 does not perturb the structure or dynamic properties of either protein. Therefore sumoylated Ets-1 behaves as “beads-on-a-string” with the two proteins tethered by flexible polypeptide segments containing the isopeptide linkage. Accordingly, SUMO-1 may mediate interactions of Ets-1 with signaling or transcriptional regulatory macromolecules by acting as a structurally independent docking module, rather than through the induction of a conformational change in either protein upon their covalent linkage. We also hypothesize that the flexibility of the linking polypeptide sequence may be a general feature contributing to the recognition of SUMO-modified proteins by their downstream effectors.},

The majority of GWAS-identified variants fall in noncoding regions of the genome. Therefore, this review focuses on strategies for assessing likely mechanisms affected by noncoding variants; such mechanisms include transcriptional regulation, noncoding RNA function, and epigenetic regulation.

	abstract = {After two decades of genetic testing and research, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are two of the most well-characterized genes in the human genome. As a result, variants of uncertain significance (VUS; also called variants of unknown significance) are reported less frequently than for genes that have been less thoroughly studied. However, VUS continue to be uncovered, even for BRCA1/2. The increasing use of multi-gene panels and whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing will lead to higher rates of VUS detection because more genes are being tested, and most genomic loci have been far less intensively characterized than BRCA1/2. In this article, we draw attention to ethical and policy-related issues that will emerge. Experience garnered from BRCA1/2 testing is a useful introduction to the challenges of detecting VUS in other genetic testing contexts, while features unique to BRCA1/2 suggest key differences between the BRCA experience and the current challenges of multi-gene panels in clinical care. We propose lines of research and policy development, emphasizing the importance of pooling data into a centralized open-access database for the storage of gene variants to improve VUS interpretation. In addition, establishing ethical norms and regulated practices for sharing and curating data, analytical algorithms, interpretive frameworks and patient re-contact are important policy areas.},

The hUBC9 protein shows highest homology to a new member of the UBC family: 54\% identity toS. cerevisiae Ubc9p and 64\% identity toSchizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) hus5. Overexpression of hUBC9 partially suppresses aS. cerevisiae ubc9 temperature-sensitive mutation, indicating that theUBC9 gene family is also functionally conserved. Like hUBC9, Sphus5 also interacts specifically with all three subunits of the CBF3 complex. However,S. cerevisiae Ubc9p interacts only with the Cbf3p subunit (64 kDa) of the CBF3 complex, indicating the specificity of the interaction betweenS. cerevisiae Ubc9 and Cbf3p proteins. The function of Ubc9p in the G2/M phase ofS. cerevisiae could be related to regulation of centromere proteins in chromosome segregation in mitosis. Therefore, the ubiquitination process and centromere function may be linked to chromosome segregation. We also provide further in vivo evidence that Mck1p, a protein kinase, is specifically associated with the centromere proteins Cbf2p and Cbf5p, which were previously shown to interact in vitro.},

To probe the mechanism of the Hsp90 chaperone that is required for the maturation of many signaling proteins in eukaryotes, we analyzed the effects of all individual amino acid changes in the ATPase domain on yeast growth rate. The sensitivity of a position to mutation was strongly influenced by proximity to the phosphates of ATP, indicating that ATPase-driven conformational changes impose stringent physical constraints on Hsp90. To investigate how these constraints may vary for different clients, we performed biochemical analyses on a panel of Hsp90 mutants spanning the full range of observed fitness effects. We observed distinct effects of nine Hsp90 mutations on activation of v-src and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), indicating that different chaperone mechanisms can be utilized for these clients. These results provide a detailed guide for understanding Hsp90 mechanism and highlight the potential for inhibitors of Hsp90 that target a subset of clients.},

	abstract = {Several single-base substitution mutations have been introduced into the lacZ alpha gene in cloning vector M13mp2, at 40-60\% efficiency, in a rapid procedure requiring only transfection of the unfractionated products of standard in vitro mutagenesis reactions. Two simple additional treatments of the DNA, before transfection, produce a site-specific mutation frequency approaching 100\%. The approach is applicable to phenotypically silent mutations in addition to those that can be selected. The high efficiency, approximately equal to 10-fold greater than that observed using current methods without enrichment procedures, is obtained by using a DNA template containing several uracil residues in place of thymine. This template has normal coding potential for the in vitro reactions typical of site-directed mutagenesis protocols but is not biologically active upon transfection into a wild-type (i.e., ung+) Escherichia coli host cell. Expression of the desired change, present in the newly synthesized non-uracil-containing covalently closed circular complementary strand, is thus strongly favored. The procedure has been applied to mutations introduced via both oligonucleotides and error-prone polymerization. In addition to its utility in changing DNA sequences, this approach can potentially be used to examine the biological consequences of specific lesions placed at defined positions within a gene.},

The relationship between gene sequence and fitness has tremendous implications for understanding both evolutionary processes and functional constraints on the encoded proteins. Here, we have exploited deep sequencing technology to experimentally determine the fitness of all possible individual point mutants under controlled conditions for a nine-amino acid region of Hsp90. Over the past five decades, limited glimpses into the relationship between gene sequence and function have sparked a long debate regarding the distribution, relative proportion, and evolutionary significance of deleterious, neutral, and advantageous mutations. Our systematic experimental measurement of fitness effects of Hsp90 mutants in yeast, evaluated in the light of existing population genetic theory, are remarkably consistent with a nearly neutral model of molecular evolution.},

How disease-associated mutations impair protein activities in the context of biological networks remains mostly undetermined. Although a few renowned alleles are well characterized, functional information is missing for over 100,000 disease-associated variants. Here we functionally profile several thousand missense mutations across a spectrum of Mendelian disorders using various interaction assays. The majority of disease-associated alleles exhibit wild-type chaperone binding profiles, suggesting they preserve protein folding or stability. While common variants from healthy individuals rarely affect interactions, two-thirds of disease-associated alleles perturb protein-protein interactions, with half corresponding to “edgetic” alleles affecting only a subset of interactions while leaving most other interactions unperturbed. With transcription factors, many alleles that leave protein-protein interactions intact affect DNA binding. Different mutations in the same gene leading to different interaction profiles often result in distinct disease phenotypes. Thus disease-associated alleles that perturb distinct protein activities rather than grossly affecting folding and stability are relatively widespread.},

	abstract = {The determinants of binding specificities of peptide recognition domains and their evolution remain important problems in molecular systems biology. Here, we present a new methodology to analyze the coevolution between a domain and its ligands by combining high-throughput phage display with deep sequencing. First, from a library of PDZ domains with diversity introduced at ten positions in the binding site, we evolved domains for binding to 15 distinct peptide ligands. Interestingly, for a given peptide many different functional domains emerged, which exhibited only limited sequence homology, showing that many different binding sites can recognize a given peptide. Subsequently, we used peptide-phage libraries and deep sequencing to map the specificity profiles of these evolved domains at high resolution, and we found that the domains recognize their cognate peptides with high affinity but low specificity. Our analysis reveals two aspects of evolution of new binding specificities. First, we were able to identify some common features amongst domains raised against a common peptide. Second, our analysis suggests that cooperative interactions between multiple binding site residues lead to a diversity of binding profiles with considerable plasticity. The details of intramolecular cooperativity remain to be elucidated, but nonetheless, we have established a general methodology that can be used to explore protein evolution in a systematic yet rapid manner.},

	abstract = {The ability to design proteins with high affinity and selectivity for any given small molecule is a rigorous test of our understanding of the physiochemical principles that govern molecular recognition. Attempts to rationally design ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however, and the computational design of protein–small-molecule interfaces remains an unsolved problem. Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the steroid digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for DIG over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and β-oestradiol, and this steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors, therapeutics and diagnostics.},

Ubiquitin-like modifications require the catalysis of three enzymes generally known as E1, E2, and E3. We solved the crystal structure of the E2 for the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) in complex with an RWD domain and confirmed the structure using solution NMR analysis. The binding surface of RWD on Ubc9 is located near the N terminus of Ubc9 that is known to be involved in noncovalent binding of the proteins in the conjugation machinery, including a domain of E1, SUMO, and an E3 ligase. NMR data indicate that the RWD domain does not bind to SUMO and E1. The interaction between RWD and Ubc9 has a Kd of 32 ± 4 μm. Consistent with the structure and binding affinity and in contrast to a previous report, the RWD domain and RWDD3 have minimal effects on global SUMOylation.

It is therefore critical to prospectively identify all vemurafenib resistance mechanisms prior to their emergence in the clinic. The vemurafenib resistance mechanisms described to date do not result from secondary mutations within BRAFV600E. To search for possible mutations within BRAFV600E that can confer drug resistance, we developed a systematic experimental approach involving targeted saturation mutagenesis, selection of drug-resistant variants, and deep sequencing. We identified a single nucleotide substitution (T1514A, encoding L505H) that greatly increased drug resistance in cultured cells and mouse xenografts. The kinase activity of BRAFV600E/L505H was higher than that of BRAFV600E, resulting in cross-resistance to a MEK inhibitor. However, BRAFV600E/L505H was less resistant to several other BRAF inhibitors whose binding sites were further from L505 than that of PLX4720. Our results identify a novel vemurafenib-resistant mutant and provide insights into the treatment for melanomas bearing this mutation.},

	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Here, we describe the structure determination of a non-covalent complex between human Ubc9 and SUMO-1 at 2.4 Å resolution. Non-covalent interactions between Ubc9 and SUMO are conserved in human and yeast insomuch as human Ubc9 interacts with each of the human SUMO isoforms, and yeast Ubc9 interacts with Smt3, the yeast SUMO ortholog. Structural comparisons reveal similarities to several other non-covalent complexes in the ubiquitin pathway, suggesting that the non-covalent Ubc9–SUMO interface may be important for poly-SUMO chain formation, for E2 recruitment to SUMO conjugated substrates, or for mediating E2 interactions with either E1 or E3 ligases. Biochemical analysis suggests that this surface is less important for E1 activation or di-SUMO-2 formation, but more important for E3 interactions and for poly-SUMO chain formation when the chain exceeds more than two SUMO proteins.},

	abstract = {The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is the most common RNA-binding domain in eukaryotes. Differences in RRM sequences dictate, in part, both RNA and protein-binding specificities and affinities. We used a deep mutational scanning approach to study the sequence-function relationship of the RRM2 domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1). By scoring the activity of more than 100,000 unique Pab1 variants, including 1246 with single amino acid substitutions, we delineated the mutational constraints on each residue. Clustering of residues with similar mutational patterns reveals three major classes, composed principally of RNA-binding residues, of hydrophobic core residues, and of the remaining residues. The first class also includes a highly conserved residue not involved in RNA binding, G150, which can be mutated to destabilize Pab1. A comparison of the mutational sensitivity of yeast Pab1 residues to their evolutionary conservation reveals that most residues tolerate more substitutions than are present in the natural sequences, although other residues that tolerate fewer substitutions may point to specialized functions in yeast. An analysis of ∼40,000 double mutants indicates a preference for a short distance between two mutations that display an epistatic interaction. As examples of interactions, the mutations N139T, N139S, and I157L suppress other mutations that interfere with RNA binding and protein stability. Overall, this study demonstrates that living cells can be subjected to a single assay to analyze hundreds of thousands of protein variants in parallel.},

	abstract = {Background—Life-threatening disorders of heart rhythm may arise during infancy and can result in the sudden and tragic death of a child. We performed exome sequencing on two unrelated infants presenting with recurrent cardiac arrest to discover a genetic cause.
Methods and Results—We ascertained two unrelated infants (probands) with recurrent cardiac arrest and dramatically prolonged QTc interval who were both born to healthy parents. The two parent-child trios were investigated using exome sequencing to search for de novo genetic variants. We then performed follow-up candidate gene screening on an independent cohort of 82 subjects with congenital long-QT syndrome without an identified genetic cause. Biochemical studies were performed to determine the functional consequences of mutations discovered in two genes encoding calmodulin. We discovered three heterozygous de novo mutations in either CALM1 or CALM2, two of the three human genes encoding calmodulin, in the two probands and in two additional subjects with recurrent cardiac arrest. All mutation carriers were infants who exhibited life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias combined variably with epilepsy and delayed neurodevelopment. Mutations altered residues in or adjacent to critical calcium binding loops in the calmodulin carboxyl-terminal domain. Recombinant mutant calmodulins exhibited several fold reductions in calcium binding affinity.
Conclusions—Human calmodulin mutations disrupt calcium ion binding to the protein and are associated with a life-threatening condition in early infancy. Defects in calmodulin function will disrupt important calcium signaling events in heart affecting membrane ion channels, a plausible molecular mechanism for potentially deadly disturbances in heart rhythm during infancy.},

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Zip1 protein is the integral component of the SC. In the absence of a DNA double-strand break or the SC initiation protein Zip3, Zip1 proteins aggregate to form a polycomplex (PC). In addition, Zip1 is also responsible for DSB-independent nonhomologous centromere coupling at early meiotic prophase. We report here that Zip3 is a SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) E3 ligase and that Zip1 is a binding protein for SUMO-conjugated products. Our results also suggest that at early meiotic prophase, Zip1 interacts with Zip3-independent Smt3 conjugates (e.g., Top2) to promote nonhomologous centromere coupling. At and after mid-prophase, the Zip1 protein begins to associate with Zip3-dependent Smt3 conjugates (e.g., Red1) along meiotic chromosomes in the wild-type cell to form SCs and with Smt3 polymeric chains in the zip3 mutant to form PCs.},

Many applications in functional proteomics and genetic engineering, including codon optimization for heterologous expression, generation of cysteine-less proteins, and alanine-scanning mutagenesis, would greatly benefit from a multiple-site mutagenesis method with high efficiency. Here we describe the development of a simple and rapid method for site-directed mutagenesis of more than 10 sites simultaneously with up to 100\% efficiency. The method uses two terminal tailed primers with a unique 25-nucleotide tail each that are simultaneously annealed to template DNA together with the set of mutagenic primers inbetween. Following synthesis of the mutant strand by primer extension and ligation with T4 DNA polymerase and ligase, the unique mutant strand-specific tails of the terminal primers are used as anchors to specifically amplify the mutant strand by high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction. We have employed this novel method to mutate simultaneously all 9 and 11 CUG leucine codons of the Hyg and Neo resistance genes, respectively, to the Candida albicans-friendly UUG leucine codon at 100\% efficiency.},

While there has been significant demand for libraries of long oligos (150mer and more), the yields in conventional DNA synthesis and the associated side reactions have previously limited the availability of oligonucleotide pools to lengths {\textless}100 nt. Using novel array based depurination assays, we show that the depurination side reaction is the limiting factor for the synthesis of libraries of long oligonucleotides on Agilent Technologies’ SurePrint® DNA microarray platform. We also demonstrate how depurination can be controlled and reduced by a novel detritylation process to enable the synthesis of high quality, long (150mer) oligonucleotide libraries and we report the characterization of synthesis efficiency for such libraries. Oligonucleotide libraries prepared with this method have changed the economics and availability of several existing applications (e.g. targeted resequencing, preparation of shRNA libraries, site-directed mutagenesis), and have the potential to enable even more novel applications (e.g. high-complexity synthetic biology).},

The consequences of SUMO-1 modification include the regulation of protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and protein subcellular localization. At present, very little is understood about the specific mechanisms that govern the recognition of proteins as substrates for SUMO-1 modification. However, many of the proteins that are modified by SUMO-1 interact directly with the SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. These interactions suggest that Ubc9 binding may play an important role in substrate recognition as well as in substrate modification. The SUMO-1 consensus sequence (SUMO-1-CS) is a motif of conserved residues surrounding the modified lysine residue of most SUMO-1 substrates. This motif conforms to the sequence “ΨKXE,” where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue, K is the lysine to which SUMO-1 is conjugated, X is any amino acid, and E is glutamic acid. In this study, we demonstrate that the SUMO-1-CS is a major determinant of Ubc9 binding and SUMO-1 modification. Mutating residues in the SUMO-1-CS abolishes both Ubc9 binding and substrate modification. These findings have important implications for how SUMO-1 substrates are recognized and for how SUMO-1 is ultimately transferred to specific lysine residues on these substrates.},

TPP synthesis in eukaryotes requires thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK), which catalyzes the transfer of a pyrophosphate group from ATP to thiamin. TPP is essential for central metabolic processes, including the formation of acetyl CoA from glucose and the Krebs cycle. Deficiencies in human thiamin metabolism result in beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy. The crystal structure of mouse TPK was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at 2.4 Å resolution, and the structure of TPK complexed with thiamin has been refined at 1.9 Å resolution. The TPK polypeptide folds as an α/β-domain and a β-sandwich domain, which share a central ten-stranded mixed β-sheet. TPK subunits associate as a dimer, and thiamin is bound in the dimer interface. Despite lacking apparent sequence homology with other proteins, the α/β-domain resembles the Rossman fold and is similar to other kinase structures, including another pyrophosphokinase and a thiamin biosynthetic enzyme. Comparison of mouse and yeast TPK structures reveals differences that could be exploited in developing species-specific inhibitors of potential use as antimicrobial agents.},

While many studies have focused individually on either expression strength or protein sequence, in principle the fitness effects of these two protein properties are interdependent. We systematically investigated the fitness effects of both expression strength and protein sequence for the yeast Hsp90 gene (Hsp82). We analyzed the fitness effects of all possible point mutations in a putative substrate binding loop under seven different expression strengths. The fitness effects of amino acid substitutions were strongly dependent on expression strength. Many point mutations exhibited fitness defects at reduced expression strength that were hidden at the natural expression strength. Revealing these hidden mutant defects suggested that this region of Hsp90 contributes to a rate-limiting step in function, consistent with its putative role in substrate binding. This study is important because it indicates that critical regions in proteins are more prevalent than would be estimated based on experimental fitness analyses performed at natural expression strengths. As hidden fitness effects are likely to occur in other systems, these findings have broad implications for the field of experimental evolution.},

However, methods for classification of variants resulting from this testing are not well studied. We evaluated the ability of a variant-classification methodology based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to define the rate of mutations and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in 180 medically relevant genes, including all ACMG-designated reportable cancer and non-cancer-associated genes, in individuals who met guidelines for hereditary cancer risk evaluation. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 404 individuals in 253 families and classified 1,640 variants. Potentially clinically actionable (likely pathogenic [LP] or pathogenic [P]) versus nonactionable (VUS, likely benign, or benign) calls were 95\% concordant with locus-specific databases and Clinvar. LP or P mutations were identified in 12 of 25 breast cancer susceptibility genes in 26 families without identified BRCA1/2 mutations (11\%). Evaluation of 84 additional genes associated with autosomal-dominant cancer susceptibility identified LP or P mutations in only two additional families (0.8\%). However, individuals from 10 of 253 families (3.9\%) had incidental LP or P mutations in 32 non-cancer-associated genes, and 9\% of individuals were monoallelic carriers of a rare LP or P mutation in 39 genes associated with autosomal-recessive cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, 95\% of individuals had at least one VUS. In summary, these data support the clinical utility of ACMG variant-classification guidelines. Additionally, evaluation of extended panels of cancer-associated genes in breast/ovarian cancer families leads to only an incremental clinical benefit but substantially increases the complexity of the results.},

Although approximately 1 in 500 people harbor missense variants in PPARG, most are of unknown consequence. To prospectively characterize PPARγ variants, we used highly parallel oligonucleotide synthesis to construct a library encoding all 9,595 possible single–amino acid substitutions. We developed a pooled functional assay in human macrophages, experimentally evaluated all protein variants, and used the experimental data to train a variant classifier by supervised machine learning. When applied to 55 new missense variants identified in population-based and clinical sequencing, the classifier annotated 6 variants as pathogenic; these were subsequently validated by single-variant assays. Saturation mutagenesis and prospective experimental characterization can support immediate diagnostic interpretation of newly discovered missense variants in disease-related genes.},

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is modified by Ub or poly-Ub at lysine (Lys)164 after DNA damage to recruit repair factors. Yeast PCNA is modified by SUMO on Lys164 and Lys127 during S-phase to recruit the anti-recombinogenic helicase Srs2. Lys164 modification requires specialized E2/E3 enzyme pairs for SUMO or Ub conjugation. For SUMO, Lys164 modification is strictly dependent on the E3 ligase Siz1, suggesting the E3 alters E2 specificity to promote Lys164 modification. The structural basis for substrate interactions in activated E3/E2–Ub/Ubl complexes remains unclear. Here we report an engineered E2 protein and cross-linking strategies that trap an E3/E2–Ubl/substrate complex for structure determination, illustrating how an E3 can bypass E2 specificity to force-feed a substrate lysine into the E2 active site.

The complex harbors the positions of five disease mutations involved with long Q-T type 3 and Brugada syndromes. In conjunction with isothermal titration calorimetry, we identify unique inactivation-gate mutations that enhance or diminish Ca2+/CaM binding, which, in turn, sensitize or abolish Ca2+ regulation of full-length channels in electrophysiological experiments. Additional biochemical experiments support a model whereby a single Ca2+/CaM bridges the C-terminal IQ motif to the DIII-IV linker via individual N and C lobes, respectively. The data suggest that Ca2+/CaM destabilizes binding of the inactivation gate to its receptor, thus biasing inactivation toward more depolarized potentials.},

	abstract = {Determining the half-life of proteins is critical for an understanding of virtually all cellular processes. Current methods for measuring in vivo protein stability, including large-scale approaches, are limited in their throughput or in their ability to discriminate among small differences in stability. We developed a new method, Stable-seq, which uses a simple genetic selection combined with high-throughput DNA sequencing to assess the in vivo stability of a large number of variants of a protein. The variants are fused to a metabolic enzyme, which here is the yeast Leu2 protein. Plasmids encoding these Leu2 fusion proteins are transformed into yeast, with the resultant fusion proteins accumulating to different levels based on their stability and leading to different doubling times when the yeast are grown in the absence of leucine. Sequencing of an input population of variants of a protein and the population of variants after leucine selection allows the stability of tens of thousands of variants to be scored in parallel. By applying the Stable-seq method to variants of the protein degradation signal Deg1 from the yeast Matα2 protein, we generated a high-resolution map that reveals the effect of ∼30,000 mutations on protein stability. We identified mutations that likely affect stability by changing the activity of the degron, by leading to translation from new start codons, or by affecting N-terminal processing. Stable-seq should be applicable to other organisms via the use of suitable reporter proteins, as well as to the analysis of complex mixtures of fusion proteins.},

	abstract = {Staying the same across a billion years
How far across evolution do families of genes retain their function? Yeast and humans are separated by roughly a billion years of evolutionary history, and yet genes from one can substitute for orthologous genes in the other. To study this effect systematically, Kachroo et al. replaced over 400 essential yeast genes with their human orthologs. Roughly half of the human genes could functionally replace their yeast counterparts. Genes being in the same pathway was as important as sequence or expression similarity in determining replaceability.
Science, this issue p. 921
To determine whether genes retain ancestral functions over a billion years of evolution and to identify principles of deep evolutionary divergence, we replaced 414 essential yeast genes with their human orthologs, assaying for complementation of lethal growth defects upon loss of the yeast genes. Nearly half (47\%) of the yeast genes could be successfully humanized. Sequence similarity and expression only partly predicted replaceability. Instead, replaceability depended strongly on gene modules: Genes in the same process tended to be similarly replaceable (e.g., sterol biosynthesis) or not (e.g., DNA replication initiation). Simulations confirmed that selection for specific function can maintain replaceability despite extensive sequence divergence. Critical ancestral functions of many essential genes are thus retained in a pathway-specific manner, resilient to drift in sequences, splicing, and protein interfaces.
Genes in the same pathway can retain their function in organisms separated by a billion years of evolutionary history.

	abstract = {The amino acid sequence of a protein governs its function. We used bulk competition and focused deep sequencing to investigate the effects of all ubiquitin point mutants on yeast growth rate. Many aspects of ubiquitin function have been carefully studied, which enabled interpretation of our growth analyses in light of a rich structural, biophysical and biochemical knowledge base. In one highly sensitive cluster on the surface of ubiquitin, almost every amino acid substitution caused growth defects. In contrast, the opposite face tolerated virtually all possible substitutions. Surface locations between these two faces exhibited intermediate mutational tolerance. The sensitive face corresponds to the known interface for many binding partners. Across all surface positions, we observe a strong correlation between burial at structurally characterized interfaces and the number of amino acid substitutions compatible with robust growth. This result indicates that binding is a dominant determinant of ubiquitin function. In the solvent-inaccessible core of ubiquitin, all positions tolerated a limited number of substitutions, with hydrophobic amino acids especially interchangeable. Some mutations null for yeast growth were previously shown to populate folded conformations indicating that, for these mutants, subtle changes to conformation caused functional defects. The most sensitive region to mutation within the core was located near the C-terminus that is a focal binding site for many critical binding partners. These results indicate that core mutations may frequently cause functional defects through subtle disturbances to structure or dynamics.},

	abstract = {Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a major modulator of Ca2+ signaling with a known role in neurotransmitter release. NCS-1 has one cryptic (EF1) and three functional (EF2, EF3, and EF4) EF-hand motifs. However, it is not known which are the regulatory (Ca2+-specific) and structural (Ca2+- or Mg2+-binding) EF-hand motifs. To understand the specialized functions of NCS-1, identification of the ionic discrimination of the EF-hand sites is important. In this work, we determined the specificity of Ca2+ binding using NMR and EF-hand mutants. Ca2+ titration, as monitored by [15N,1H] heteronuclear single quantum coherence, suggests that Ca2+ binds to the EF2 and EF3 almost simultaneously, followed by EF4. Our NMR data suggest that Mg2+ binds to EF2 and EF3, thereby classifying them as structural sites, whereas EF4 is a Ca2+-specific or regulatory site. This was further corroborated using an EF2/EF3-disabled mutant, which binds only Ca2+ and not Mg2+. Ca2+ binding induces conformational rearrangements in the protein by reversing Mg2+-induced changes in Trp fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity. In a larger physiological perspective, exchanging or replacing Mg2+ with Ca2+ reduces the Ca2+-binding affinity of NCS-1 from 90 nM to 440 nM, which would be advantageous to the molecule by facilitating reversibility to the Ca2+-free state. Although the equilibrium unfolding transitions of apo-NCS-1 and Mg2+-bound NCS-1 are similar, the early unfolding transitions of Ca2+-bound NCS-1 are partially influenced in the presence of Mg2+. This study demonstrates the importance of Mg2+ as a modulator of calcium homeostasis and active-state behavior of NCS-1.},

	abstract = {Statistical analysis of protein evolution suggests a design for natural proteins in which sparse networks of coevolving amino acids (termed sectors) comprise the essence of three-dimensional structure and function. However, proteins are also subject to pressures deriving from the dynamics of the evolutionary process itself—the ability to tolerate mutation and to be adaptive to changing selection pressures. To understand the relationship of the sector architecture to these properties, we developed a high-throughput quantitative method for a comprehensive single-mutation study in which every position is substituted individually to every other amino acid. Using a PDZ domain (PSD95pdz3) model system, we show that sector positions are functionally sensitive to mutation, whereas non-sector positions are more tolerant to substitution. In addition, we find that adaptation to a new binding specificity initiates exclusively through variation within sector residues. A combination of just two sector mutations located near and away from the ligand-binding site suffices to switch the binding specificity of PSD95pdz3 quantitatively towards a class-switching ligand. The localization of functional constraint and adaptive variation within the sector has important implications for understanding and engineering proteins.},

	abstract = {Protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution of various biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive description would contribute considerably to the functional interpretation of fully sequenced genomes, which are flooded with novel genes of unpredictable functions. We previously developed a system to examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between the approximately 6,000 proteins of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278 proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those obtained by the other project [Uetz, P., et al. (2000) Nature (London) 403, 623-627] and hence have substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary interactions generates a single huge network linking the vast majority of the proteins. Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically relevant interactions highlights various intriguing subnetworks. They include, for instance, the one that had successfully foreseen the involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body function as well as the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified multiprotein complex potentially participating in the process of vesicular transport. Our data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually leads to thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.},

In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins.

Both Y2H and affinity-purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS) data are of equally high quality but of a fundamentally different and complementary nature resulting in networks with different topological and biological properties. Compared to co-complex interactome models, this binary map is enriched for transient signaling interactions and inter-complex connections with a highly significant clustering between essential proteins.

	abstract = {Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is the primordial member of the neuronal calcium sensor family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins. It interacts with both the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), regulating its internalization and surface expression, and the cognate kinases GRK1 and GRK2. Determination of the crystal structures of Ca2+/NCS-1 alone and in complex with peptides derived from D2R and GRK1 reveals that the differential recognition is facilitated by the conformational flexibility of the C-lobe-binding site. We find that two copies of the D2R peptide bind within the hydrophobic crevice on Ca2+/NCS-1, but only one copy of the GRK1 peptide binds. The different binding modes are made possible by the C-lobe-binding site of NCS-1, which adopts alternative conformations in each complex. C-terminal residues Ser-178–Val-190 act in concert with the flexible EF3/EF4 loop region to effectively form different peptide-binding sites. In the Ca2+/NCS-1·D2R peptide complex, the C-terminal region adopts a 310 helix-turn-310 helix, whereas in the GRK1 peptide complex it forms an α-helix. Removal of Ser-178–Val-190 generated a C-terminal truncation mutant that formed a dimer, indicating that the NCS-1 C-terminal region prevents NCS-1 oligomerization. We propose that the flexible nature of the C-terminal region is essential to allow it to modulate its protein-binding sites and adapt its conformation to accommodate both ligands. This appears to be driven by the variability of the conformation of the C-lobe-binding site, which has ramifications for the target specificity and diversity of NCS-1.},

We report a unique crystal structure of a 77-residue fragment of the CaV1.2 α1 subunit carboxyl terminus, which includes a tandem of the pre-IQ and IQ domains, in complex with Ca2+·CaM in 2 distinct binding modes. The structure of the CaV1.2 fragment is an unusual dimer of 2 coiled-coiled pre-IQ regions bridged by 2 Ca2+·CaMs interacting with the pre-IQ regions and a canonical CaV1-IQ–Ca2+·CaM complex. Native CaV1.2 channels are shown to be a mixture of monomers/dimers and a point mutation in the pre-IQ region predicted to abolish the coiled-coil structure significantly reduces Ca2+-dependent inactivation of heterologously expressed CaV1.2 channels.},

In conjunction with isothermal titration calorimetry, we identify unique inactivation-gate mutations that enhance or diminish Ca2+/CaM binding, which, in turn, sensitize or abolish Ca2+ regulation of full-length channels in electrophysiological experiments. Additional biochemical experiments support a model whereby a single Ca2+/CaM bridges the C-terminal IQ motif to the DIII-IV linker via individual N and C lobes, respectively.

The active-site cysteine residue is conserved among all known SUMO-specific proteases and is not substitutable by serine in the hydrolysis reactions demonstrated previously in yeast. We report here that the catalytic domain of human protease SENP1 (SUMO-specific protease 1) mutant SENP1CC603S carrying a mutation of cysteine to serine at the active site is inactive in maturation and de-conjugation reactions. To further understand the hydrolytic mechanism catalysed by SENP1, we have determined, at 2.8 Å resolution (1 Å=0.1 nm), the X-ray structure of SENP1CC603S–SUMO-1 complex. A comparison of the structure of SENP2–SUMO-1 suggests strongly that SUMO-specific proteases require a self-conformational change prior to cleavage of peptide or isopeptide bond in the maturation and de-conjugation processes respectively. Moreover, analysis of the interface of SENP1 and SUMO-1 has led to the identification of four unique amino acids in SENP1 that facilitate the binding of SUMO-1. By means of an in vitro assay, we further demonstrate a novel function of SENP1 in hydrolysing the thioester linkage in E1-SUMO and E2-SUMO complexes. The results disclose a new mechanism of regulation of the sumoylation pathway by the SUMO-specific proteases.},

Common features within the active site include a 90° kink proximal to the scissile bond that forces C-terminal amino acid residues or the lysine side chain toward a protease surface that appears optimized for lysine deconjugation. Analysis of this surface reveals SENP2 residues, particularly Met497, that mediate, and in some instances reverse, in vitro substrate specificity. Mutational analysis and biochemistry provide a mechanism for SENP2 substrate preferences that explains why SENP2 catalyzes SUMO deconjugation more efficiently than processing.},

	abstract = {Sumoylation has recently been identified as an important mechanism that regulates protein interactions and localization in essential cellular functions, such as gene transcription, subnuclear structure formation, viral infection, and cell cycle progression. A SUMO binding amino acid sequence motif (SBM), which recognizes the SUMO moiety of modified proteins in sumoylation-dependent cellular functions, has been consistently identified by several recent studies. To understand the mechanism of SUMO recognition by the SBM, we have solved the solution structure of SUMO-1 in complex with a peptide containing the SBM derived from the protein PIASX (KVDVIDLTIESSSDEEEDPPAKR). Surprisingly, the structure reveals that the bound orientation of the SBM can reverse depending on the sequence context. The structure also reveals a novel mechanism of recognizing target sequences by a ubiquitin-like module. Unlike ubiquitin binding motifs, which all form helices and bind to the main β-sheet of ubiquitin, the SBM forms an extended structure that binds between the α-helix and a β-strand of SUMO-1. This study provides a clear mechanism of the SBM sequence variations and its recognition of the SUMO moiety in sumoylated proteins.},

	abstract = {Summary
PML and several other proteins localizing in PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NB) contain phosphoSIMs (SUMO-interacting motifs), and phosphorylation of this motif plays a key role in their interaction with SUMO family proteins. We examined the role that phosphorylation plays in the binding of the phosphoSIMs of PML and Daxx to SUMO1 at the atomic level. The crystal structures of SUMO1 bound to unphosphorylated and tetraphosphorylated PML-SIM peptides indicate that three phosphoserines directly contact specific positively charged residues of SUMO1. Surprisingly, the crystal structure of SUMO1 bound to a diphosphorylated Daxx-SIM peptide indicate that the hydrophobic residues of the phosphoSIM bind in a manner similar to that seen with PML, but important differences are observed when comparing the phosphorylated residues. Together, the results provide an atomic level description of how specific acetylation patterns within different SUMO family proteins can work together with phosphorylation of phosphoSIM’s regions of target proteins to regulate binding specificity.},

	abstract = {Members of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family can be covalently attached to the lysine residue of a target protein through an enzymatic pathway similar to that used in ubiquitin conjugation, and are involved in various cellular events that do not rely on degradative signalling via the proteasome or lysosome. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of SUMO-modification-induced protein functional transfer. During DNA mismatch repair, SUMO conjugation of the uracil/thymine DNA glycosylase TDG promotes the release of TDG from the abasic (AP) site created after base excision, and coordinates its transfer to AP endonuclease 1, which catalyses the next step in the repair pathway. Here we report the crystal structure of the central region of human TDG conjugated to SUMO-1 at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure reveals a helix protruding from the protein surface, which presumably interferes with the product DNA and thus promotes the dissociation of TDG from the DNA molecule. This helix is formed by covalent and non-covalent contacts between TDG and SUMO-1. The non-covalent contacts are also essential for release from the product DNA, as verified by mutagenesis.},

A pool of DNA sequences encoding 10(12) random decapeptides was incubated in an Escherichia coli S30 coupled transcription/translation system. Polysomes were isolated and screened by affinity selection of the nascent peptides on an immobilized monoclonal antibody specific for the peptide dynorphin B. The mRNA from the enriched pool of polysomes was recovered, copied into cDNA, and amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to produce template for the next round of in vitro synthesis and selection. A portion of the amplified template from each round was cloned into a filamentous phagemid vector to determine the specificity of peptide binding by phage ELISA and to sequence the DNA. After four rounds of affinity selection, the majority of clones encoded peptides that bound specifically to the antibody and contained a consensus sequence that is similar to the known epitope for the antibody. Synthetic peptides corresponding to several of these sequences have binding affinities ranging from 7 to 140 nM. The in vitro system described here has the potential to screen peptide libraries that are three to six orders of magnitude larger than current biological peptide display systems.},

In fact, the occurrence of novel mutations in each generation explains why these reproductively lethal disorders continue to occur in our population.

	abstract = {The T-box transcription factor TBX22 is essential for normal craniofacial development, as demonstrated by the finding of nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, or missense mutations in patients with X-linked cleft palate (CPX) and ankyloglossia. To better understand the function of TBX22, we studied 10 different naturally occurring missense mutations that are phenotypically equivalent to loss-of-function alleles. Since all missense mutations are located in the DNA-binding T-box domain, we first investigated the preferred recognition sequence for TBX22. Typical of T-box proteins, the resulting sequence is a palindrome based around near-perfect copies of AGGTGTGA. DNA-binding assays indicate that missense mutations at or near predicted contact points with the DNA backbone compromise stable DNA-protein interactions. We show that TBX22 functions as a transcriptional repressor and that TBX22 missense mutations result in impaired repression activity. No effect on nuclear localization of TBX22 was observed. We find that TBX22 is a target for the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-1 and that this modification is required for TBX22 repressor activity. Although the site of SUMO attachment at the lysine at position 63 is upstream of the T-box domain, loss of SUMO-1 modification is consistently found in all pathogenic CPX missense mutations. This implies a general mechanism linking the loss of SUMO conjugation to the loss of TBX22 function. Orofacial clefts are well known for their complex etiology and variable penetrance, involving both genetic and environmental risk factors. The sumoylation process is also subject to and profoundly affected by similar environmental stresses. Thus, we suggest that SUMO modification may represent a common pathway that regulates normal craniofacial development and is involved in the pathogenesis of both Mendelian and idiopathic forms of orofacial clefting.},

Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals. Mutations in RYR2, encoding the cardiac sarcoplasmic calcium channel, have been identified as causative in approximately half of all dominantly inherited CPVT cases. Applying a genome-wide linkage analysis in a large Swedish family with a severe dominantly inherited form of CPVT-like arrhythmias, we mapped the disease locus to chromosome 14q31-32. Sequencing CALM1 encoding calmodulin revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.161A{\textgreater}T [p.Asn53Ile]) segregating with the disease. A second, de novo, missense mutation (c.293A{\textgreater}G [p.Asn97Ser]) was subsequently identified in an individual of Iraqi origin; this individual was diagnosed with CPVT from a screening of 61 arrhythmia samples with no identified RYR2 mutations. Both CALM1 substitutions demonstrated compromised calcium binding, and p.Asn97Ser displayed an aberrant interaction with the RYR2 calmodulin-binding-domain peptide at low calcium concentrations. We conclude that calmodulin mutations can cause severe cardiac arrhythmia and that the calmodulin genes are candidates for genetic screening of individual cases and families with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and unexplained sudden cardiac death.},

These proteins, working in concert, enhanced SUMO conjugation to lysine-744 of SATB1. Overexpression of SUMO or PIAS in Jurkat cells, which express high levels of endogenous SATB1, exhibited enhanced caspase cleavage of this MAR-associating protein. Sumoylation-deficient SATB1 (SATB1(K744R)) failed to display the characteristic caspase cleavage pattern; however, fusion of SUMO in-frame to SATB1(K744R) restored cleavage. A SUMO-independent interaction of inactive caspase-6 and SATB1 was noted. A subset of total cellular SATB1 localized into promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies where enhanced SATB1 cleavage was detected subsequent to caspase activation. These results reveal a novel sumoylation-directed caspase cleavage of this key regulatory molecule. The role of regulated proteolysis of SATB1 may be to control transcription in immune cells during normal cell functions or to assist in efficient and rapid clearance of nonfunctional or potentially damaging immune cells.},

	abstract = {Cell signaling, one of key processes in both normal cellular function and disease, is coordinated by numerous interactions between membrane proteins that change in response to stimuli. We present a split ubiquitin–based method for detection of integral membrane protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in human cells, termed mammalian-membrane two-hybrid assay (MaMTH). We show that this technology detects stimulus (hormone or agonist)-dependent and phosphorylation-dependent PPIs. MaMTH can detect changes in PPIs conferred by mutations such as those in oncogenic ErbB receptor variants or by treatment with drugs such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib. Using MaMTH as a screening assay, we identified CRKII as an interactor of oncogenic EGFR(L858R) and showed that CRKII promotes persistent activation of aberrant signaling in non–small cell lung cancer cells. MaMTH is a powerful tool for investigating the dynamic interactomes of human integral membrane proteins.},

The cleavage releases a transcription factor, which activates reporter genes in the nucleus. As a result, interaction between membrane proteins can be analyzed by the means of a colorimetric assay. We use membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum as a model system. Wbp1p and Ost1p are both subunits of the oligosaccharyl transferase membrane protein complex. The Alg5 protein also localizes to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, but does not interact with the oligosaccharyltransferase. Specific interactions are detected between Wbp1p and Ost1p, but not between Wbp1p and Alg5p. The new system might be useful as a genetic and biochemical tool for the analysis of interactions between membrane proteins in vivo.},

	abstract = {Various modifications of the conventional yeast two-hybrid system have played an essential role in confirming or detecting protein-protein interactions among nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. These approaches have permitted the identification of novel interaction partners, as well as provided hints as to their function. However, membrane proteins, such as receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein–coupled receptors, membrane-bound phosphatases, and transporters, which represent important classes of signaling molecules, are difficult to study using classical protein interaction assays because of their hydrophobic nature. Here, we describe a genetic system that allows the identification of integral membrane-interacting proteins. This so-called "split-ubiquitin membrane-based yeast two-hybrid assay" involves fusing the halves of ubiquitin to two interacting proteins, at least one of which is membrane bound. Upon interaction of these two proteins, the halves of ubiquitin are brought together, and the transcription factor that is fused to a membrane protein of interest is cleaved and released. The free transcription factor then enters the nucleus and activates transcription of reporter genes. We also describe how this technology is used to screen complementary DNA libraries to identify novel binding partners of a membrane protein of interest.},

	abstract = {High‐throughput binary protein interaction mapping is continuing to extend our understanding of cellular function and disease mechanisms. However, we remain one or two orders of magnitude away from a complete interaction map for humans and other major model organisms. Completion will require screening at substantially larger scales with many complementary assays, requiring further efficiency gains in proteome‐scale interaction mapping. Here, we report Barcode Fusion Genetics‐Yeast Two‐Hybrid (BFG‐Y2H), by which a full matrix of protein pairs can be screened in a single multiplexed strain pool. BFG‐Y2H uses Cre recombination to fuse DNA barcodes from distinct plasmids, generating chimeric protein‐pair barcodes that can be quantified via next‐generation sequencing. We applied BFG‐Y2H to four different matrices ranging in scale from {\textasciitilde}25 K to 2.5 M protein pairs. The results show that BFG‐Y2H increases the efficiency of protein matrix screening, with quality that is on par with state‐of‐the‐art Y2H methods.
