\chapter{Variant maps with hypercomplementation}
\label{apdx:maps}
As was shown in chapter 3 section~\ref{sec:hypercomp}, phylogenetic analysis of \gene{UBE2I} and \gene{SUMO1} both showed that variants with ability to complement yeast better than wild-type are likely deleterious in humans. Thus, fitness scores were transformed so that such hypercomplementing mutations are considered to be deleterious. However, since hypercomplementing substitutions may provide interesting clues about differences between yeast and human cellular contexts, the untransformed versions the maps are provided below.
